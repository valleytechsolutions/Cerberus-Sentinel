# Credit to JustCallMeKoko and the ESP32 Marauder contributors

**Thank you to [JustCallMeKoko (Just Call Me Koko)](https://github.com/justcallmekoko),
creator of [ESP32 Marauder](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder),
and the contributors who help build it.** Cerberus's Marauder-derived features
benefit from their original code, implementation work, and shared knowledge.
Credit for that upstream work stays with its authors; Cerberus-specific ports,
adaptations, and integration are described separately.

From [@valleytechsolutions](https://github.com/valleytechsolutions):
"Koko gave me permission to bring this work into Cerberus, and I want to make
sure he gets his roses. Thank you for sharing your code and making this possible."

## License and original notices

The retained [ESP32 Marauder MIT license](../LICENSES/ESP32Marauder.txt) names
`Copyright (c) 2020 Just Call Me Koko`. Keep the complete license and original
copyright notices with the copied or derived material. Public acknowledgments
supplement those notices. The permission acknowledgment above records the
contributor's thanks; it does not change the upstream license or the separate
licenses of other code and data in this repository.

## Source provenance for the rev81 contribution

The [recorded baseline](MARAUDER_DEVELOP_BASELINE.md) identifies the pinned
upstream snapshots: `master` commit
[`511bb3694d0c4dc064888e762bde44fcc9b7f48a`](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/tree/511bb3694d0c4dc064888e762bde44fcc9b7f48a)
and `develop` commit
[`79cc6bcba1db6679baee1dab2b0c1ad5010e6363`](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/tree/79cc6bcba1db6679baee1dab2b0c1ad5010e6363).
Those snapshots have the same source tree. Future ports should record the
specific revision actually used rather than treating a moving branch as a pin.

Examples of source-level attribution already retained in this contribution:

| Cerberus source | Credited upstream material |
| --- | --- |
| [`shared/wifi_ap_clone.c`](../shared/wifi_ap_clone.c) | Marauder frame layout and post-SSID IE sequence; the comment names the upstream revision and file locations and identifies the Cerberus construction, bounds checking, and parser work. |
| [`shared/wifi_ap_job.c`](../shared/wifi_ap_job.c) | Packet layouts derived from the pinned Marauder revision, with Koko's copyright and a link to the retained MIT notice. |
| [`shared/wifi_sae_commit.c`](../shared/wifi_sae_commit.c) | Frame layout following the pinned Marauder source; the comment identifies the new bounded serializer and retains upstream credit. |

These are examples, not an exhaustive authorship inventory. The
[source inventory](MARAUDER_SOURCE_INVENTORY.json) and
[coverage ledger](MARAUDER_COVERAGE_LEDGER.md) record the wider reference baseline
and implementation status. Studying a feature as a reference, adapting its code,
and completing its hardware acceptance are distinct claims.

## Carry this credit into future contributions

- Name **JustCallMeKoko and the ESP32 Marauder contributors** in the PR description
  whenever the change ports, adapts, or directly builds on their work. Link the
  [original project](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder).
- Identify the affected features, upstream files, and exact revision. Say which
  code was copied or adapted and which behavior was used only as a reference.
- Preserve the relevant source comments, original copyright notices, and full
  license text. Keep other upstream contributors' credits too.
- Describe the Cerberus-specific changes and validation separately, so readers
  can follow both the original work and the integration work.
- Keep this acknowledgment visible in the README and include the appropriate
  notices with distributions that contain the derived work.

The [pull request template](../.github/pull_request_template.md) includes an
attribution prompt to help carry these details forward.
